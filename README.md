# Advent of Code 2022
Learn through play. Time to learn to appreciate high-level languages by scripting in c++. Maybe one day I'll learn to appreciate c++ by playing [TIS-100](https://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/). 

### Notes:
- Makefiles require literal tabs, not spaces. In vim, this is:
    - `i` to enter insert mode
    - `CTRL-v` to "insert next non-digit literally"
    - `TAB` key
- Variables defined in inner code blocks will not be accessible in outer code blocks.
- Need to learn when to use `const`, `&`, and `*` modifiers. 
- Come back to set operations in isolation.
